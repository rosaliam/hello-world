# hello-world
Welcome to my GitWorld
I just joined GitHub to learn coding.  I am very excited!
My professional background is in Software QA for over 17 years.  I enjoy finding defects in the applications and troubleshoot the issues.  I use SQL server to verify the data or troubleshoot database issues.  
Now, I am excited to learn more about coding and need to figure out which programming language(s) I want to learn.  I also want to learn more about SQL Server and hopefully can be a database developer.  So far, I have taken various introduction classes such as HTML and CSS, JavaScript, Java, etc.  I have not decided which one I want to go to the next level.  However, I am going to take intermediate level SQL Server class.
